# ipc-socket /home/$USER/.i3/i3-ipc.sock
# made i3 crash btw
# By default, an IPC socket will be created in
#  $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/i3/ipc-socket.%p if the directory is available,
#  falling back to /tmp/i3-%u.XXXXXX/ipc-socket.%p,
#  where %u is your UNIX username,
#  %p is the PID of i3 and XXXXXX is a string of random characters
#  from the portable filename character set (see mkdtemp(3)).
