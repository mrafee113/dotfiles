		-- Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
		--
		-- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
		--
		-- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
		-- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
		--
		-- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
		-- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
		-- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
		-- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
		--
		-- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
		--  - Go to definition
		--  - Find references
		--  - Autocompletion
		--  - Symbol Search
		--  - and more!
		--
		-- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
		-- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
		--
		-- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
		-- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`
